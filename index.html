<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn’t said.” - Peter Drucker</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Core Problem:</strong> Decision trees are often praised for their interpretability and ability to handle both numerical and categorical variables. But what happens when we encode categorical variables as numbers? How does this affect our understanding of feature importance?</p>
<p><strong>What is Feature Importance?</strong> In decision trees, feature importance measures how much each variable contributes to reducing impurity (or improving prediction accuracy) across all splits in the tree. It’s a key metric for understanding which variables matter most for your predictions.</p>

<span class="screen-reader-only">Important</span>🎯 The Key Insight: Encoding Matters for Interpretability
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> When we encode categorical variables as numerical values (like 1, 2, 3, 4…), decision trees treat them as if they have a meaningful numerical order. This can completely distort our analysis.</p>
<p><strong>The Real-World Context:</strong> In real estate, we know that neighborhood quality, house style, and other categorical factors are crucial for predicting home prices. But if we encode these as numbers, we might get misleading insights about which features actually matter most.</p>
<p><strong>The Devastating Reality:</strong> Even sophisticated machine learning models can give us completely wrong insights about feature importance if we don’t properly encode our variables. A categorical variable that should be among the most important might appear irrelevant, while a numerical variable might appear artificially important.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s assume we want to predict house prices and understand which features matter most. The key question is: <strong>How does encoding categorical variables as numbers affect our understanding of feature importance?</strong></p>

<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ames-housing-dataset"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> The Ames Housing Dataset 🏠</h2>
<p>We are analyzing the Ames Housing dataset which contains detailed information about residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. This dataset is perfect for our analysis because it contains a categorical variable (like zip code) and numerical variables (like square footage, year built, number of bedrooms).</p>

<h2 data-number="1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem-zipcode-as-numerical-vs-categorical"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> The Problem: ZipCode as Numerical vs Categorical</h2>
<p><strong>Key Question:</strong> What happens when we treat zipCode as a numerical variable in a decision tree? How does this affect feature importance interpretation?</p>
<p><strong>The Issue:</strong> Zip codes (50010, 50011, 50012, 50013) are categorical variables representing discrete geographic areas, i.e.&nbsp;neighborhoods. When treated as numerical, the tree might split on “zipCode &gt; 50012.5” - which has no meaningful interpretation for house prices. Zip codes are non-ordinal categorical variables meaning they have no inherent order that aids house price prediction (i.e.&nbsp;zip code 99999 is not the priceiest zip code).</p>

<p>You have not been coached through setting up a Python environment.

Alternatively, delete the Python code and only leave the remaining R code that is provided.

<h2 data-number="1.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-discussion"><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Discussion Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Your Task:</strong> Add thoughtful narrative answers to these two questions in the Discussion Questions section of your rendered HTML site. ## Discussion Questions {#sec-discussion}</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Numerical vs Categorical Encoding:</strong> There are four models above, two in R and two in Python. For each language, the models differ by how zip code is modelled, either as a numerical variable or as a categorical variable. Given what you know about zip codes and real estate prices, how should zip code be modelled, numerically or categorically?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think Zip Code should be modeled categorically, not numerically. Treating it as a number creates fake order (e.g., “50013 &gt; 50012”) and leads trees to make threshold splits that have no geographic meaning, which can distort feature importance. In R, the rpart package handles this correctly by treating zip codes as factors, allowing the model to split by meaningful groups of areas rather than numeric thresholds. In Python, the DecisionTreeRegressor does not natively handle categorical data, so if zip codes are entered as numbers, the model will misinterpret them as ordered values. To address this, one-hot encoding should be used so that each zip code is treated as its own category. In short, zip codes should be modeled as categorical variables, with factors in R and one-hot encoded features in Python, so the model can correctly capture neighborhood patterns and provide accurate, interpretable results.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>R vs Python Implementation Differences:</strong> When modelling zip code as a categorical variable, the output tree and feature importance differs quite significantly between R and Python. Investigate why this is the case. Which language would you say does a better job of modelling zip code as a categorical variable? Why is this the case? Do you see any documentation suggesting the other language does a better job? If so, please provide a quote from the documentation.</li>
</ol>
<p>R and Python handle categorical data differently, which explains their contrasting decision tree results. In R, the rpart function naturally supports categorical variables. When zip code is defined as a factor, R automatically groups categories to create meaningful splits, such as separating certain neighborhoods from others. This makes the model’s output easier to interpret.</p>
<p>Python’s DecisionTreeRegressor, however, cannot process categorical data directly. Zip codes must be converted using one-hot encoding, which creates separate columns for each value. This spreads the importance of location across multiple columns, making the results harder to interpret.</p>
<p>According to scikit-learn documentation, “Decision trees do not support categorical variables directly. Categorical variables need to be converted to numerical form (for example, by using one-hot encoding).” In short, R handles categorical data more naturally and produces a clearer, more interpretable model than Python.</p>

<p><strong>No coding assistance expected:</strong> This challenge is designed for independent analysis and critical thinking. You are <strong>not</strong> expected to use AI for coding help or to write code for you. You are <strong>not</strong> expected to code at all unless curious about any ideas you may have.</p>
<p><strong>AI as unreliable thought partner:</strong> If you choose to use AI tools, treat them as an unreliable thought partner. AI responses should be verified and cross-checked rather than accepted at face value.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation verification required:</strong> For question 2, you must investigate the official documentation for both <code>rpart</code> (R) and <code>sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor</code> (Python) to understand why the two implementations yield vastly different results when handling categorical variables. Your analysis should be grounded in the actual documentation and technical specifications of these libraries, not AI-generated explanations. AI can be helpful in digesting the documentation, but you must verify the information is correct.</p>
